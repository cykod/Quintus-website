# Introduction

The Quintus engine is an HTML5 game engine designed to be modular and lightweight, with a concise JavaScript-friendly syntax. In lieu of trying to shoehorn a standard OOP-game engine structure into an HTML5 JavaScript engine, Quintus takes some cues from jQuery and provides plugins, events and a selector syntax. Instead of a deep single-inheritance-only model, Quintus provides a flexible component model in addition to traditional inheritance to make it easier to reuse functionality and share it across games and objects.

## History of Quintus

The initial version of Quintus was built over the course of writing [Professional HTML5 Mobile Game Development](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0094P2TU6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0094P2TU6&linkCode=as2&tag=tun02-20), although the repo code has diverged a bit from the Engine built in the book, the main philosophy and technologies used have not changed, and reading the book will give you a fairly exhaustive understanding of the internals of the Quintus Engine.

## About this Guide

This guide was written January 2013 on vacation in Jamaica while under the influence of many Red Stripes - there may be a few typos and inconsistencies as well as the occasional random reference to Bob Marley. Rest assured those will get cleaned up over the coming weeks.
